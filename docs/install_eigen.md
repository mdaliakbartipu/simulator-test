#Install Eigen
Installing Eigen library is easy!

1. Get the latest stable 3.x release such as [3.3.2](http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.3.2.zip).
2. Unzip somewhere on your drive and create environment variable named `EIGEN_ROOT` with value equal to path of the folder. 
If the unzipped folder is named `eigen-eigen-da9b4e14c255` rename that to `eigen3` because the folder
that EIGEN_ROOT points to should contain a single `eigen3` folder and all the eigen source should be inside that.
