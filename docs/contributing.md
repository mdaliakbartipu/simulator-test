# Contributing
Use [usual steps](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) to contribute just like other GitHub projects. When your pull request is created, you might get prompted to one-time sign [Contributer License Agreement (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) unless changes are minor. It's very simple and takes less than a minute.

# Testing
We ask that you clean compile your changes on Windows or Linux and test that the basic simulator operations
still work. If your change is breaking the build, we might start to lose trust in your contributions :). If your change is significant, you might want to test on *both* Linux and Windows to be sure.

# Coding Style
We have the [sweet and short coding guideline](coding_guidelines.md) document you might have yet seen.
