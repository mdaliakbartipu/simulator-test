# Testing

We ask that you clean compile your changes on Windows and Linux, and test that the basic simulator operations
still work.  We are in the process of setting up continuous integration with a test suite... 

# Coding Style

We are mostly following the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

We re not religous about opening brace always at the end of the line, for Classes and Methods and Namespaces 
it is often nice to have the brace at the beginning of the line.  But for smaller statements inside a method
body we like the brace at the end of the line.
