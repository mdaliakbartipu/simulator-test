# Coming Soon
Unreal Environments are highly detailed and generates very large files. We are still trying to figure out the best strategy to host our big binaries. If you would like to contribute or have any suggestions, [let us know](issues/). We might make binaries available through private channels as a one-off item to select individuals. Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot make some of our environments available as a source code.
