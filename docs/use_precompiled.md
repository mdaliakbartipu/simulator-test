# Download Binaries

## Windows
1. Download binaries for the Neighborhood environment from the [latest release](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/releases) and run `AirSimNeighbourhood.bat`.
2. Remote control is required if you want to fly manually. See [remote control setup](remote_control.md) for more details. Alternatively you can use [APIs](docs/apis.md) for programmatic control or use so-called [Computer Vision mode](image_apis.md) to move around using keyboard.


Note: If you want to set up your own Unreal environment then you will need to [build it](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/#how-to-get-it) yourself.

## Linux
Binaries for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is coming soon. For now you will need to [build it on Linux](build_linux.md) yourself.
