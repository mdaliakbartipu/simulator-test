# Coming Soon
Unreal Environments are highly detailed and generates very large files. We are still trying to figure out the best strategy to host these big binaries. 

We *might* be able to make binaries available through private channels as a one-off item to select individuals. Due to licensing 
restrictions, we cannot make some of our environments available as source code.
