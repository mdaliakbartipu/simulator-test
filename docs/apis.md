#AirSim APIs
## Introduction
AirSim exposes APIs so you can interact with vehicle in the simulation programmatically. You can use these APIs to retrieve images, get state, control the vehicle and so on. The APIs use [msgpack-rpc protocol](https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc) over TCP/IP which allows you to use variety of programming languages including C++, C#, Python, Java etc.

## Hello Drone
Here's very quick overview of how to use AirSim APIs using C++ (see also [Python example](python.md)):

```
#include <iostream>
#include "control/RpcLibClient.hpp"

int main() 
{
    using namespace std;
    msr::airlib::RpcLibClient client;

    cout << "Press Enter to use offboard control" << endl; cin.get();
    client.setOffboardMode(true);

    cout << "Press Enter to arm the drone" << endl; cin.get();
    client.armDisarm(true);

    cout << "Press Enter to takeoff" << endl; cin.get();
    client.takeoff(5);

    cout << "Press Enter to move 5 meters in x direction with 1 m/s velocity" << endl; cin.get();  
    auto position = client.getPosition(); // from current location
    client.moveToPosition(position.x() + 5, position.y(), position.z(), 1);

    cout << "Press Enter to land" << endl; cin.get();
    client.land();

    return 0;
}

```

You can find a ready to run project in HelloDrone folder in the repository. See more about [Hello Drone](hello_drone.md).

## Image / Computer Vision and Collision APIs
AirSim offers comprehensive images APIs to retrieve synchronized images from multiple cameras along with ground truth including depth, disparity, surface normals and vision. You can set the resolution, FOV, motion blur etc parameters in [settings.json](settings.md). There is also API for detecting collision state. See also [complete code](../Examples/StereoImageGenerator.hpp) that generates specified number of stereo images and ground truth depth with normalization to camera plan, computation of disparity image and saving it to pfm format.

### APIs for Multirotors
Multirotor can be controlled by specifying angles, velocity vector, destination position or some combination of these. There are corresponding `move*` APIs for this purpose. When doing position control, we need to use some path following algorithm. By default AirSim uses carrot following algorithm. This is often referred to as "high level control" because you just need to specify very high level goal and the firmware takes care of the rest. Currently lowest level control available in AirSim is moveByAngle API however we will be adding more lower level controls soon as well.

## Often Encountered Parameters
### duration and max_wait_seconds
Many API methods has parameters named `duration` or: `max_wait_seconds`.

Methods that take `float duration`, like `moveByVelocity`y return control immediately. So you can therefore choose to sleep for this duration, or you can change their mind and call something else which will automatically cancel the `moveByVelocity`.

Methods that take `float max_wait_seconds`, like `takeoff`, `land`, `moveOnPath`, `moveToPosition`, `moveToZ`, and so will block this amount of time waiting for command to be successfully completed. If the command completes before the max_wait_seconds they will return True, otherwise
if the `max_wait_seconds` times out they will return `false`.  If you want to wait for ever pass a big number. But if you want to be able to interrupt even these commands pass 0 and you can do something else or sleep in a loop while checking the drone position, etc. We would not recommend interrupting takeoff/land on a real drone, of course, as the results may be unpredictable.

### drivetrain
Many APIs take `drivetrain` parameter which specifies how vehicle is oriented while it moves. For example, a quadrotor may move in West direction while its front is pointing towards North. In fact, quad rotors can move in all 3 axis while its front is pointing to any direction. In this mode of movement, vehicle uses its maximum degree of freedom. In forward-only mode, vehicle move only in the direction its pointing to. So if quadrotor is pointing to North and if we want it to move along West then we must reorient it. This mode is useful if we have only one sensor in the front.

### yaw_mode
Many APIs take `yaw_mode` parameter which specifies where vehicle should be pointing to. For example, you may want to move quadrotor while its front is pointing to North-East which means you will set `YawMode::is_rate = false` and `YawMode::yaw_or_rate = 90` (angle unit is degrees for Yaw). In some weired world, you might want your vehicle to continuously rotate at, say 20-degrees/sec, while it moves. YawMode allows you to specify that by setting  `YawMode::is_rate = true` and `YawMode::yaw_or_rate = 20`. However in more sane scenarios, you just don't want yaw to change which you can do by setting yaw rate of 0. The shothand for this is `YawMode::Zero()`. 

### lookahead and adaptive_lookahead
When you ask vehicle to follow a path, AirSim uses "carrot following" algorithm. This algorithm operates by looking ahead on path and adjusting its velocity vector. The parameters for this algorithm is specified by `lookahead` and `adaptive_lookahead`. For most of the time you want algorithm to auto-decide the values by simply setting `lookahead = -1` and `adaptive_lookahead = 0`.

## Using APIs on Real Vehicles
We want to be able to run *same code* that runs in simulation as on real vehicle. This allows you to test your code in simulator and deploy to real vehicle. 

Generally speaking, APIs therefore shouldn't allow you to do something that cannot be done on real vehicle (for example, getting the ground truth). But, of course, simulator has much more information and it would be useful in applications that may not care about running things on real vehicle. For this reason, we clearly delineate between sim-only APIs by attaching `sim` prefix and we recommend that you don't use these APIs if you do care about real vehicle deployment.

The AirLib is self-contained library that you can put on an offboard computing module such as the Gigabyte barebone Mini PC. This module then can talk to the flight controllers such as Pixhawk using exact same code and flight controller protocol. The code you write for testing in the simulator remains unchanged. See [AirLib on custom drones](/custom_drone.md).
