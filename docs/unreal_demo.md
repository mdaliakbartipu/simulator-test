# Setting up Unreal environment for AirSim

There are two ways to get Unreal Environment up and running:

First is to just use pre-configured environment called Blocks available in your cloned repo  in folder `Unreal/Environments/Blocks`. 
To keep the repo size small, the Blocks environment is very lightweight and doesn't contain assets that looks like real world. 
It's still good for development and testing and setting it up is very easy. To get Blocks environment up and running [follow these steps](unreal_blocks.md).

Another way is to setup Unreal environment from Marketplace that looks like real world and shows off the strength of Unreal Engine's rendering capabilities. This is little bit smore 
involved but worthwhile. Here are [step-by-step instructions](unreal_custenv.md) on how to do this.
