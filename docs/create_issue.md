# How to Create Issue or Ask Question Effectively

AirSim is open source project and contributors like you keeps it going. There are always a lot less contributors than there are users in most projects so it is important to respect their time and effort when you are asking a question or filing an issue.

Here's what you can do:

1. [Search issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if someone already has asked it.
2. Chose title that is short but summarizes well.
3. Make your question to the point and precise.
4. Write exact error messages, call stack, logs. Avoid screen shots if you can copy and paste text.
5. Tell us what you were doing.
6. Tell us which OS, AirSim version, vehicle mode (car/multirotor/PX4) etc you are using.
7. Copy and paste relevant section of your settings.json.
